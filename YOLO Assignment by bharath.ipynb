    "### YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fundamental Idea:**\n",
    "   - YOLO's core idea is to divide an image into a grid and predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from grid cells, providing a holistic view of the scene in a single forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **YOLO 0 vs. Traditional Sliding Window:**\n",
    "   - YOLO processes the entire image simultaneously, considering global context, while traditional methods analyze regions separately, leading to redundancy and slower processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prediction in YOLO 0:**\n",
    "   - YOLO predicts bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height) and class probabilities for each grid cell. Multiple bounding boxes can be predicted for each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advantages of Anchor Boxes:**\n",
    "   - Anchor boxes provide reference shapes, allowing the model to better handle variations in object sizes and aspect ratios, leading to improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Object Scales in YOLO 3:**\n",
    "   - YOLO 3 uses Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) to address the challenge of detecting objects at different scales, ensuring robust detection across the entire image.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Darknet3 Architecture:**\n",
    "   - Darknet3 is the feature extraction architecture used in YOLO 3. It's a deep neural network designed for hierarchical feature extraction from the input image.\n",
