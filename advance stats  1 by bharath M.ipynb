    "Q1. The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value. It is used to define the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. The PDF represents the relative likelihood of observing different values of the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. There are various types of probability distributions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normal distribution\n",
    "- Binomial distribution\n",
    "- Poisson distribution\n",
    "- Exponential distribution\n",
    "- Uniform distribution\n",
    "- Chi-square distribution\n",
    "- Student's t-distribution\n",
    "- F-distribution\n",
    "- Gamma distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples, and there are many other probability distributions used in statistics and probability theory.\n",

    "Q3. Here's a Python function to calculate the probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "def normal_pdf(x, mean, std_dev):\n",
    "    coefficient = 1 / (std_dev * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))\n",

    "    pdf = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)\n",
    "    return pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The properties of the Binomial distribution include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "- Each trial has two possible outcomes: success (typically denoted as \"1\") or failure (typically denoted as \"0\").\n",
    "- The trials are independent, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of the others.\n",
    "- The probability of success (denoted as \"p\") is constant across all trials.\n",
    "- The number of successes follows a discrete probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples where the Binomial distribution can be applied are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flipping a coin: The distribution can be used to model the number of heads obtained when flipping a fair coin a fixed number of times.\n",
    "2. Quality control: The distribution can be used to model the number of defective items in a sample taken from a production line, where each item is either defective or non-defective.\n",

    "Q5. Here's an example of generating a random sample of size 1000 from a binomial distribution with a probability of success of 0.4 and plotting a histogram using matplotlib:\n",

    "def poisson_cdf(k, mean):\n",

    "Q7. The main differences between the Binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, whereas the Poisson distribution describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "- The Binomial distribution has two parameters: the number of trials and the probability of success, while the Poisson distribution has only one parameter: the average rate of event occurrence.\n",
    "- The Binomial distribution is discrete, while the Poisson distribution is often used to approximate discrete events in continuous settings.\n",
    "- As the number of trials in a Binomial distribution becomes large while the probability of success remains small, it approaches the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Here's an example of generating a random sample of size 1000 from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 5 and calculating the sample mean and variance:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "sample_size = 1000\n",
    "mean = 5\n",
    "\n",

    "sample = np.random.poisson(mean, sample_size)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate sample mean and variance\n",

    "print(\"Sample Mean:\", sample_mean)\n",
    "print(\"Sample Variance:\", sample_variance)\n",

    "\n",
    "Q9. In both the Binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The mean (μ) represents the average number of successes or events.\n",
    "- The variance (σ^2) is equal to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the Binomial distribution, the variance is influenced by both the number of trials and the probability of success, while in the Poisson distribution, the variance is solely determined by the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. In a normal distribution, the least frequent data appears in the tails of the distribution, specifically in the extreme values. These are the values that are several standard deviations away from the mean. In a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), the least frequent data appears in the tails beyond -2 and +2 standard deviations. However, in a normal distribution with a different mean and standard deviation, the least frequent data would appear in the tails beyond -2 standard deviations from the mean."
