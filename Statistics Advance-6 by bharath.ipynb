    "Q1. Assumptions of ANOVA and Violations:\n",
    "Assumptions of ANOVA include:\n",
    "1. **Homogeneity of Variance**: The variances of the groups being compared should be approximately equal.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: Observations within each group are assumed to be independent.\n",
    "3. **Normality**: The data within each group should follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violations that could impact validity:\n",
    "1. **Homogeneity of Variance Violation**: Unequal variances can affect the validity of the F-test and post-hoc comparisons.\n",
    "2. **Independence Violation**: If observations are not independent, it can lead to pseudoreplication and affect the error term.\n",
    "3. **Normality Violation**: Departure from normality can impact the validity of p-values and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Types of ANOVA and When to Use:\n",
    "1. **One-Way ANOVA**: Used when comparing means of three or more groups for a single categorical independent variable.\n",
    "2. **Two-Way ANOVA**: Used when there are two independent variables, allowing analysis of main effects and interaction effects.\n",
    "3. **Repeated Measures ANOVA**: Used when the same subjects are measured at multiple time points or under multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Partitioning of Variance and Importance:\n",
    "Partitioning of variance decomposes the total variation in the data into components attributed to different sources. It's important to understand because it helps identify the sources of variability and the proportion of variability explained by factors, aiding interpretation and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Calculation of SST, SSE, and SSR in One-Way ANOVA (Python):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",

    "\n",
    "data = [group_data_1, group_data_2, group_data_3]  # Replace with your data\n",
    "overall_mean = np.mean(np.concatenate(data))\n",
    "sst = sum((x - overall_mean)**2 for group in data for x in group)\n",

    "\n",
    "Q6. Interpretation of F-statistic and p-value in One-Way ANOVA:\n",
    "A low p-value (e.g., p < 0.05) indicates that at least one group mean is significantly different from the others. The F-statistic represents the ratio of variance between groups to variance within groups. If the F-statistic is large and the p-value is small, you can conclude that there are significant differences between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Handling Missing Data in Repeated Measures ANOVA:\n",
    "You can use techniques like imputation or mixed-effects models to handle missing data. Consequences of different methods include bias, inflated Type I error rates, or decreased power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Common Post-Hoc Tests and Usage:\n",
    "- **Tukey's HSD**: Used when comparing all pairwise group means.\n",
    "- **Bonferroni Correction**: Controls familywise error rate when conducting multiple comparisons.\n",
