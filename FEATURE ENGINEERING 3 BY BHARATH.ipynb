    "Q1: **Data Encoding and its Use in Data Science**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical or textual data into numerical representations that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It is useful in data science because many machine learning algorithms require numerical input data. Encoding categorical data allows algorithms to work effectively with diverse types of data, enabling accurate predictions and analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: **Nominal Encoding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding assigns a unique integer to each category without any specific order or ranking among them. It is useful when categories have no inherent order or when the algorithm doesn't assume any relationship between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset of movie genres: [Action, Romance, Comedy, Sci-Fi]. Nominal encoding could map these genres to integers: Action (0), Romance (1), Comedy (2), Sci-Fi (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: **When Nominal Encoding is Preferred Over One-Hot Encoding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred when:\n",
    "- Categories have no meaningful order or ranking.\n",
    "- The number of unique categories is relatively large.\n",
    "- The algorithm can handle ordinal relationships between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Example:\n",
    "In a dataset of car colors, where colors have no inherent order (e.g., Red, Blue, Green, Yellow), nominal encoding could be used to represent each color with a unique integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: **Encoding Technique for Categorical Data with 5 Unique Values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small number of unique values, nominal encoding can be used, as it assigns a unique integer to each category. This approach maintains the information while reducing dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding, which could be less efficient for a small number of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: **Calculating New Columns for Nominal Encoding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use nominal encoding to transform two categorical columns in a dataset with 1000 rows, you would create one new column for each categorical column. Each new column contains unique integers representing the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: **Encoding for Animal Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the animal dataset, you could use nominal encoding if the categorical features, such as species, habitat, and diet, do not have a specific order or ranking. This would allow you to represent each category with a unique integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: **Encoding Categorical Data for Customer Churn Prediction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the given dataset with 5 features, you could use the following encoding techniques:\n",
    "1. **Nominal Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Apply nominal encoding to gender and contract type columns since they have no inherent order.\n",
    "   - For gender: Male (0), Female (1)\n",
    "   - For contract type: Month-to-Month (0), One Year (1), Two Year (2)\n",
    "2. **Leave Numerical Columns Unchanged**:\n",
    "   - Monthly charges and tenure are numerical and can be used as they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "After encoding, your dataset would have the transformed gender and contract type columns, ready for use in machine learning algorithms."
