    "Q1: To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean of the time spent studying (X̄) and the mean of the exam scores (Ȳ).\n",
    "2. Calculate the differences between each value of time spent studying (X) and the mean of time spent studying (X̄).\n",
    "3. Calculate the differences between each value of exam scores (Y) and the mean of exam scores (Ȳ).\n",
    "4. Multiply the differences for each pair of data points (X - X̄) and (Y - Ȳ).\n",
    "5. Calculate the squared differences for time spent studying and exam scores.\n",
    "6. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "r = Σ((X - X̄) * (Y - Ȳ)) / √(Σ(X - X̄)² * Σ(Y - Ȳ)²)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) will range between -1 and 1. If it's close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship, implying that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores tend to increase. If it's close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship, suggesting that more time spent studying leads to lower exam scores. A value close to 0 indicates a weak or no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: To calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rank the values of each variable separately.\n",
    "2. Calculate the differences in ranks for each pair of data points.\n",
    "3. Calculate the Spearman's rank correlation using the formula:\n",
    "\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- d represents the differences in ranks\n",
    "- n is the number of data points\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ) will range between -1 and 1. A positive value suggests a positive monotonic relationship, where higher levels of sleep are associated with higher job satisfaction. A negative value suggests a negative monotonic relationship. A value close to 0 suggests little or no monotonic relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Calculate both the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the number of hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) for the sample of 50 participants. Compare the results to see if there are any differences in the strength or direction of the relationships.\n",
    "\n",
