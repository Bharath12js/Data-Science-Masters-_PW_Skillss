    "Q1: Estimation statistics involves making inferences and drawing conclusions about population parameters based on sample data. It is used to estimate unknown population parameters, such as the population mean or proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point Estimate: A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the population parameter. It is obtained from the sample data and serves as the best guess for the unknown parameter. For example, the sample mean is often used as a point estimate for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interval Estimate: An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. It accounts for the uncertainty associated with estimating the parameter. The range is typically expressed as a confidence interval, which indicates the level of confidence that the true parameter falls within the interval. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean would provide a range of values within which we can be 95% confident the true mean lies.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is used to assess the validity of claims or assumptions about a population parameter. It helps determine if there is enough evidence to support or reject a hypothesis. By evaluating the statistical significance of the results, it allows researchers to make informed decisions and draw conclusions about the population.\n",

    "Q7: The steps involved in hypothesis testing are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the hypotheses: Clearly define the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (Ha) based on the research question or problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the significance level: Determine the desired level of significance (α), which represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Common significance levels are 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%).\n",

    "4. Determine the critical region: Determine the critical region or rejection region based on the chosen significance level and the type of test being conducted (one-tailed or two-tailed).\n",

    "In hypothesis testing, the p-value is compared to the significance level (α) to make a decision regarding the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than or equal to α, the results are considered statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than α, the results are not statistically significant, and there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
