    "Q1. **Difference between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   - **Linear Regression:** Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous numeric output based on one or more input features. It models a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.\n",
    "   - **Logistic Regression:** Logistic regression is used for predicting a binary categorical outcome (usually 0 or 1) based on one or more input features. It models the probability of the binary outcome using the logistic function. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not based on features like sender, subject, and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example Scenario for Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   Predicting whether a patient has a certain medical condition (e.g., diabetes) based on features like age, BMI, blood pressure, etc. Here, the outcome is binary (has the condition or not), making logistic regression more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Cost Function and Optimization in Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   The cost function used in logistic regression is the **log loss** (also known as cross-entropy loss). It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. The goal is to minimize the log loss. Optimization is typically done using iterative optimization algorithms like gradient descent, which adjusts the model's coefficients to minimize the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Regularization in Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   Regularization adds a penalty term to the logistic regression cost function to prevent overfitting. Common regularization techniques include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which add the absolute or squared values of the coefficients to the cost function. Regularization helps control the complexity of the model by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, thus reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **ROC Curve and Evaluation of Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1 - specificity) for different threshold values in a binary classification model like logistic regression. It helps visualize the model's performance across different discrimination thresholds and aids in selecting an appropriate threshold based on the problem's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Feature Selection Techniques in Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   - **Backward Elimination:** Starting with all features and iteratively removing the least significant ones based on p-values.\n",
    "   - **Forward Selection:** Starting with no features and iteratively adding the most significant ones based on p-values.\n",
    "   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Iteratively removes the least important features based on model performance.\n",
    "   - **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Automatically selects important features by driving some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These techniques improve performance by reducing noise, improving model interpretability, and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Handling Imbalanced Datasets:**\n",
    "   - **Resampling:** Oversample the minority class or undersample the majority class to balance class distribution.\n",
    "   - **Synthetic Data Generation:** Generate synthetic samples for the minority class using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).\n",
    "   - **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Assign different misclassification costs to different classes to give more importance to the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Common Issues and Challenges:**\n",
    "   - **Multicollinearity:** When independent variables are highly correlated, it can affect coefficient interpretation and model stability. Solutions include removing one of the correlated variables or using dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "   - **Convergence Issues:** Gradient descent may not converge if the learning rate is too high or if the data is not properly scaled. Adjust learning rate and scale data appropriately.\n",
    "   - **Outliers:** Outliers can influence the coefficients and predictions. Robust techniques like Huber loss or removing outliers can be used.\n",
